# Scripts reference

## Overview

`src/` is the TypeScript CLI entry point. It uses commander to register subcommands and execa to dispatch each one to the corresponding `manage-*.sh` script in `scripts/`. All domain logic remains in bash. Use `@/` absolute imports (mapped to `src/` in `tsconfig.json`).

`scripts/` contains core maintenance scripts, sandbox provisioning, domain entry points, and shared library functions. Lib functions are sourced, never executed directly. Each `manage-*.sh` dispatches to subcommands only: no domain logic lives in entry points directly.

| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `verify.sh`        | `check`    | Runs format, format check, spell check, shell check, and index drift check in sequence         |
| `update.sh`        | `update`   | Interactive dep update via `bun update --interactive`, then verify                             |
| `clean.sh`         | `clean`    | Wipes `node_modules/`, clears bun cache, reinstalls from lockfile                              |
| `snapshot.sh`      | `snapshot` | Writes project file tree to `.claude/.tmp/project/PROJECT-SNAPSHOT.md` for Claude chat context |
| `regen-indexes.sh` |            | Rewrites `prompts/index.md` and `standards/index.md` from the files present in each folder     |

## manage-sync.sh

`aitk sync [target]` runs all installed domain syncs in sequence (standards, snippets, prompts, governance, antigravity, claude), then runs a git workflow step. The git workflow detects which domains changed, shows a preview of the commit and PR body, then prompts with three options: "Commit and open PR" (the default, stages, commits, creates `chore/toolkit-sync`, pushes, opens a PR via `gh`), "Commit only" (stages, commits, creates the branch, stops before push), and "Cancel" (skips the workflow entirely). The PR body lists up to three changed filenames per domain, then a count for the rest.

Claude role sync runs under `AITK_NON_INTERACTIVE=1` so the embedded call does not prompt. The combined PR preview is the single confirmation gate. Role drift lands under a `claude/` domain line when any of `PLANNER.md`, `IMPLEMENTER.md`, or `REVIEWER.md` changed. Seed audits stay a manual step through the `claude-seed-sync` skill. `aitk sync` prints a tip pointing at the skill when `.claude/` is present.

If `.claude/GOV.md` exists in the target after governance sync, it is regenerated automatically by calling `manage-claude.sh gov` with `AITK_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`.

The git workflow step is skipped if the target is not a git root (no `.git/`), `gh` is not installed, or `chore/toolkit-sync` already exists locally or on the remote.

## UI framing across exec boundaries

`manage-*.sh` dispatchers that hand off via `exec` lose any trap set in the parent, so a parent-opened `┌` block never closes. Each subcommand script under `scripts/<domain>/` owns its own frame: open `┌` and print a title line at the top of `main()`, before any `select_option` or `ask` call. Only open the parent frame in the dispatcher when the picker is needed to resolve the subcommand name, then close it with `└` before `exec`.

- `scripts/manage-tooling.sh` is the reference for conditional parent framing
- `scripts/tooling/{list,ref,sync,create}.sh` each open `┌` and print `│ aitk tooling <subcommand>` at the top of `main()`
- Prompts and `log_*` calls assume a frame is open. Opening the frame early prevents dangling `│` output on error paths.

## lib

**`ui.sh`**: source this in any script that needs terminal output. Provides the color palette, all `log_*` functions, `select_option` and `ask` for user prompts, `select_or_route_scenario` for sandbox scenario routing, `guard_root` (rejects toolkit root as a target), and `require_project_root`. When `AITK_NON_INTERACTIVE=1` is set, `select_option` auto-selects the first option and `ask` returns the default value without blocking. `select_or_route_scenario` reads `SANDBOX_SCENARIO` and skips the picker when set, letting agents target a specific scenario via `aitk sandbox <cat>:<cmd> <scenario>`.

`log_*` functions write to stderr so structured output on stdout pipes clean through wrappers. Use `printf` or `echo` without redirection for data meant to be consumed. When adding a command that calls `select_option` or `ask`, verify the non-interactive path works with `AITK_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`.

**`inject.sh`**: tooling injection helpers used by `tooling/sync.sh` and sandbox scripts. The key distinction: configs always overwrite, seeds merge-only. `inject_tooling_manifest` is the orchestrator. It ties together missing dep installation, script injection, and gitignore merging in one call.

**`gov.sh`**: sourced by both `gov/build.sh` and `claude/prompt.sh`. Contains `build_rules_payload`, which strips frontmatter and concatenates `.mdc` files into a temp file. Accepts an optional space-separated filter of rule names. When provided, only those rules are included. Both consumers call the same function. Don't duplicate this logic if adding a third.

**`tooling.sh`**: defines `TOOLING_STACK_EXCLUDE` and exposes `list_tooling_stacks` and `is_tooling_stack_excluded`. Consumed by `scripts/tooling/{list,ref,sync,create}.sh` for discovery and name validation. Excluded names print a redirect error pointing at the correct CLI and exit 1. Any future folder under `tooling/` that is not a real stack routes through the same helper.

**`index.sh`**: sourced by `scripts/prompts/{install,sync}.sh`, `scripts/manage-standards.sh`, `scripts/standards/list.sh`, and `scripts/core/regen-indexes.sh`. Exposes `read_h1_title` (reads the first H1 from a markdown file) and `write_index` (scans a directory for `*.md` files and writes an `index.md` listing each one with its H1 as the description). Per-domain title and subtitle strings (`PROMPTS_INDEX_TITLE`, `PROMPTS_INDEX_SUBTITLE`, `STANDARDS_INDEX_TITLE`, `STANDARDS_INDEX_SUBTITLE`) live here too so install, sync, and the toolkit's own regen step all emit the same header.
