# Tooling system

## Overview

Golden configs in `configs/` are the source of truth. Seeds, references, sandboxes, and AI audit commands all consume them. Sync auto-discovers new stacks, so adding one requires no infrastructure changes.

## Structure

## Configs vs seeds vs references vs gitignore

Configs are golden files and the source of truth. On sync they always overwrite the target. Drift is always wrong.

Seeds are user-owned files that grow with the project. Dictionary files (`.cspell/`) accumulate project-specific terms over time. For the `claude` stack, state documents (`REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, etc.) are seeds; they are created once and then owned by the user. Sync appends only what's missing and never overwrites. Stacks ship seeds pre-populated with terms they introduce, such as `shellcheck` and `vitest`.

References are `reference.md` files synced to `tooling/<stack>.md` in target projects. They are AI audit context. Sync them with `aitk tooling ref`, which respects the extends chain.

Gitignore entries are declared in `manifest.toml` under `[gitignore]` as named groups. They merge automatically on sync. The process is additive only; existing entries are never touched.

Dependencies and scripts declared in `manifest.toml` under `[dependencies.dev]` and `[scripts]` are injected into `package.json`. Similar to seeds, only missing entries are added; existing dependencies or scripts are not modified or overwritten.

## Extends chain

`manifest.toml` declares `extends = "base"`. The full chain resolves recursively: base applies first, the derived stack overlays second. This applies to configs, seeds, references, and gitignore equally.

## CLI

| Command                           | What it does                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aitk tooling [stack] [path]`     | Full sync: configs, seeds, deps, gitignore                 |
| `aitk tooling ref [stack] [path]` | Sync reference docs for a stack and its parents            |
| `aitk tooling create`             | Create a new stack folder with stub manifest and reference |

## Common workflows

Sync to a fresh project: `aitk tooling` → sync → pick stack → enter path.

Scaffold a new stack: `aitk tooling create` → enter name → stub structure created in `tooling/<name>/`.

## Testing

Each stack has a sandbox at `scripts/sandbox/tooling/<stack>.sh`. Run via `aitk` → tooling → pick scenario. The sandbox provisions a project, injects configs and seeds, installs deps, and runs the full `verify.sh` pipeline. It catches config typos, version incompatibilities, and missing dictionary terms.

## Adding a new stack

1. Run `aitk tooling create` to generate the stub structure
2. Add golden config files to `tooling/<n>/configs/`
3. Add pre-populated seed files to `tooling/<n>/seeds/`
4. Fill in `manifest.toml` with `extends`, deps, scripts, and optionally `[gitignore]`
5. Fill in `reference.md` with prose documentation
6. Create `scripts/sandbox/tooling/<n>.sh`: inject configs, seeds, manifest, run verify
7. Test via `aitk` → tooling → `<n>`

Sync auto-discovers the new stack.

## Notes

- Commit golden config changes with `--no-verify`. Lint-staged runs on the template files themselves, not project source.
- `cspell.json` references `.cspell/` dictionaries. Seeds must exist, even if empty, or cspell errors on missing paths.
- Tooling configs are concrete files and skip the governance build compilation step.
- Gemini stack seeds `.gemini/settings.json` only — no deps, no scripts. It gitignores `.gemini/.tmp/` and the user-owned `.gemini/settings.json`.
