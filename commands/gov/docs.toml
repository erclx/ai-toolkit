## 4. RESPONSE FORMAT

# EXECUTION

```bash
echo '📦 Installing Assets...'
mkdir -p docs

cat << 'GEMINI_EOF' > docs/conventional-commits.md
# CONVENTIONAL COMMITS REFERENCE

## STATUS

- **Current**: 1.0.0
- **Owner**: Release Manager
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-08

## PRINCIPLES

- Structure commits atomically, ensuring one logical change per commit.
- Use standard semantic types (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `docs`, `perf`, `test`) to drive automated versioning.
- Enforce lowercase subject lines to ensure visual consistency in logs.
- Write subject lines in the imperative mood (e.g., \"add field\" not \"added field\").
- Use single-word scopes that map to the directory or component modified.

## COMMANDS

```bash
# Stage all changes (verify diff first!)
git add .

# Commit using the CLI wizard (if installed)
gemini /git:commit

# Manual commit format
git commit -m \"type(scope): subject\"
```

## EXAMPLES

### ✅ Correct Pattern

```text
feat(auth): add jwt token validation middleware
fix(navbar): resolve z-index overlay issue on mobile
chore(deps): upgrade typescript to v5.4
refactor(utils): simplify date parsing logic
```

### ❌ Incorrect Pattern

```text
# Do not use uppercase
Feat(Auth): Added JWT token validation

# Do not use vague scopes
fix(misc): fixed bug

# Do not use past tense
chore(deps): upgraded packages

# Do not use periods at the end
docs(readme): update installation guide.
```

## CONSTRAINTS

- Limit subject lines to a maximum of 72 characters.
- Avoid filler words like \"updates\", \"changes\", or \"tweaks\" in the subject.
- Do not commit \"work in progress\" to shared branches; squash them locally first.
- Add a body paragraph separated by a blank line for complex changes.

# PULL REQUESTS REFERENCE

## STATUS

- **Current**: 1.0.1
- **Owner**: Lead Engineer
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-08

## PRINCIPLES

- Document *only* what currently exists in the code in PR descriptions; reject future promises or \"work in progress\" narratives.
- Write all bullet points and titles in the imperative mood (e.g., \"Add handler\" not \"Added handler\").
- Exclude meta-commentary or conversational filler (e.g., \"This PR,\" \"I have,\" \"Included are\").
- Treat code diffs as raw data; descriptions must objectively reflect the diff without marketing adjectives (e.g., \"robust,\" \"seamless\").

## COMMANDS

```bash
# generate PR description using the git agent
gemini /commands/git/pr.toml

# Manual creation via GitHub CLI (adhering to standards)
gh pr create --title \"type(scope): subject\" --body-file .gemini/.tmp/pr-body.md --draft
```

## EXAMPLES

### ✅ Correct Pattern

```markdown
## Summary
Implement JWT validation middleware to secure API endpoints.

## Key Changes
- Add `validateToken` function to `auth/middleware.ts`
- Inject middleware into `/api/v1/user` routes
- Update error handling to return 401 on invalid signatures

## Technical Context
- Uses `jose` library for stateless verification to reduce db load

## Testing
- `npm test tests/auth/middleware.test.ts`
- Verified expired token returns 401 via Postman
```

### ❌ Incorrect Pattern

```markdown
## Summary
This PR updates the auth system to be more robust and seamless. I worked hard on this.

## Key Changes
- I added a new file for validation
- Changed the routes
- Fixed some bugs that were annoying

## Technical Context
- It is a game-changer for our security.

## Testing
- Tested locally.
```

## CONSTRAINTS

- MUST follow `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` title format (strictly lowercase, max 72 chars).
- FORBIDDEN words include \"robust,\" \"seamless,\" \"enhanced,\" \"allows,\" and \"game-changer.\"
- MUST ONLY include visuals if `<DIFF_STATS>` indicates changes to UI/CSS files.
- FORBIDDEN to use past tense in summary or key changes (e.g., \"Added\" -> \"Add\").
