# TYPESCRIPT STANDARDS

## Type Declarations

- Enforce explicit types or strict inference using `unknown` over `any`.
- Reject the `any` type absolutely.
- Use `interface` for object shapes and component props.
- Use `type` for unions, intersections, and utility types.
- Do not prefix interfaces with `I`.

## Type Safety

- Use discriminated unions for error handling over throwing exceptions.
- Use built-in utility types (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`) over manual type manipulation.
- Prefer `readonly` properties for data objects.
- Do not use `enum`; use constant objects or unions.
- Do not use non-null assertions.

## Imports and Configuration

- Use absolute imports mapping `@/` to `src/`.
- Use `import type` for type-only imports to enable proper tree-shaking.
- Enable `strict: true` in tsconfig.json with no exceptions.

## Async Patterns

- Use `Promise.all()` for independent operations to avoid serial waterfalls.
- Do not use `return await` inside try/catch blocks.
