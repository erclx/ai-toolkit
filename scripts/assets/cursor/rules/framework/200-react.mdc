# REACT ARCHITECTURE STANDARDS

## HARD REQUIREMENTS

- Enforce strict `kebab-case` for all files including components.
- Place domain logic in `src/features/` and restrict `src/components/` to shared UI.
- Import environment variables only from the validated configuration module.
- Use named exports exclusively for components and hooks.
- Encapsulate data fetching and complex effects in custom hooks.
- Define TypeScript interfaces for props immediately above the component.
- Use function declarations for components, not arrow functions.
- Use stable, unique keys for list items; never use array index.
- Name event handlers with `handle` prefix: `handleClick`, `handleSubmit`.
- Avoid prop drilling beyond 2 levels; use context or composition.
- Use `<>` shorthand for fragments unless key prop is required.

## NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS

- Do not use PascalCase or camelCase for filenames.
- Do not use default exports.
- Do not place feature-specific components in the global components folder.
- Do not use `useEffect` for derived state; use `useMemo`.
