# WORKFLOW STANDARDS

## AGENT OPERATING PROCEDURE

### 1. Planning Phase

- Analyze the request and output a concise, numbered implementation plan.
- Identify strictly necessary file creations, modifications, and deletions.
- Wait for user confirmation before executing complex or destructive actions.

### 2. Execution Phase

- Implement changes iteratively, focusing on one logical concern at a time.
- Apply the "Zero-Bloat" principle to all code changes.
- Ensure all new files adhere to strict file hygiene (one newline at EOF).

### 3. Verification Phase

- Run the full verification suite using `bun run verify` to ensure type safety and test passing.
- Execute `bun run build` to confirm production build stability.
- Resolve all errors revealed by these commands immediately before proceeding.

### 4. Quality Assurance Phase

- Enforce code style and formatting using `bun run lint:fix`.
- Check for spelling errors using `bun run spell`.
- Manually review changes against the "Zero-Comment" and "Ventilated Prose" policies.

### 5. Delivery Phase

- Generate a Conventional Commit message using the defined format.
- Ensure the commit subject is strictly lowercase and under 72 characters.
- Do not use trailing periods in commit subjects.

## NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS

- Do not modify code without a preceding plan step.
- Do not commit code that fails the `bun run verify` check.
- Do not leave "TODO" comments; implement the logic or reject the feature.
- Do not use `git add .` blindly; stage only relevant files.
- Do not bypass the `lint:fix` step; style consistency is mandatory.
