# NODE WORKFLOW STANDARDS

## HARD REQUIREMENTS

- Analyze requests and output a numbered implementation plan before execution.
- Execute a fail-fast verification sequence: `` `bun run format` `` -> `` `bun run lint:fix` `` -> `` `bun run typecheck` `` -> `` `bun run test` `` -> `` `bun run build` ``.
- Stage verified files using `` `git add` `` individually and verify with `` `git status` ``.
- Signal completion to the user for manual review and commit.

## NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS

- Do not execute the heavy `` `bun run check` `` script; use the individual fail-fast steps.
- Do not execute `` `git commit` ``; hand off the staged environment to the user.
- Do not proceed to subsequent verification steps if a previous step fails.
- Do not modify code without a confirmed plan.
