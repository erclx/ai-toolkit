# REACT ARCHITECTURE STANDARDS

## HARD REQUIREMENTS

- Enforce `kebab-case` naming for all files including components.
- Import environment variables strictly from the validated configuration module.
- Co-locate domain logic, components, and hooks within the `src/features/` directory.
- Restrict the `src/components/` directory to generic, domain-agnostic UI elements.
- Encapsulate all data fetching logic within custom hooks or query libraries.
- Use functional components exclusively with named exports.
- Extract complex logic and effect chains into custom hooks.
- Define strict TypeScript interfaces for props immediately above the component.

## NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS

- Do not use PascalCase for filenames.
- Do not access `import.meta.env` or `process.env` directly.
- Do not place domain-specific logic in the shared components folder.
- Do not fetch data directly inside `useEffect`.
- Do not use class components.
- Do not use inline styles; leverage Tailwind utility classes.
- Do not use `useEffect` for derived state; use `useMemo`.
- Do not spread props into DOM elements without a specific generic wrapper.
