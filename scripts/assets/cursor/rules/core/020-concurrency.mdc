# CONCURRENCY STANDARDS

## HARD REQUIREMENTS

- Make async operations cancellable; clean up on component unmount or request abort.
- Coordinate dependent async operations explicitly; document execution order.
- Protect shared mutable state with locks, queues, or single-writer patterns.
- Batch independent operations; avoid sequential execution when parallelizable.

## NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS

- Do not fire-and-forget async operations without cleanup handlers.
- Do not mutate shared state from multiple concurrent contexts.
- Do not ignore race conditions in user-triggered async flows.
