# PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

## Resource Loading

- Lazy load resources at architectural boundaries (routes, features), not inline.
- Do not import entire modules when subsets are sufficient.

## Execution Efficiency

- Batch independent operations; avoid sequential execution when parallelizable.
- Defer non-critical work until after user-visible rendering completes.
- Do not fetch data inside loops.

## Rendering

- Virtualize or paginate unbounded lists.
- Do not optimize without measurement.
