# ERROR HANDLING STANDARDS

## HARD REQUIREMENTS

- Validate inputs at system boundaries; reject invalid data immediately.
- Distinguish expected failures (validation, not found) from unexpected failures (null reference, network timeout).
- Return structured error types for recoverable failures; propagate exceptions for programmer errors.
- Include actionable context in error messages; never expose internal implementation details.

## NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS

- Do not use exceptions for control flow.
- Do not silently ignore errors.
- Do not log sensitive data in error messages.
