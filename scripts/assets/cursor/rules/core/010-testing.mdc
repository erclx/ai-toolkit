# TESTING STANDARDS

## HARD REQUIREMENTS

- Structure tests using the Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA) pattern.
- Test user-visible behavior rather than implementation details.
- Name tests using "should" or descriptive phrases: "should validate email format".
- Ensure tests are independent; each test should run in isolation without side effects.
- Group related tests using describe/context blocks; keep nesting shallow (max 2 levels).
- Use factory functions or builders for test data; avoid inline object literals.
- Always await async operations; avoid fire-and-forget promises in tests.
- Select elements by accessibility attributes first.

## NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS
- Do not use snapshot testing for verification.
- Do not test private functions or internal state directly.
- Do not use conditional logic or loops within test bodies.
