# LOGGING STANDARDS

## HARD REQUIREMENTS

- Log state transitions at boundaries (requests received, external calls made, errors encountered).
- Use structured formats with consistent metadata (timestamp, severity, correlation ID).
- Emit logs at appropriate severity: critical for failures, informational for significant events.

## NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS

- Do not log in performance-critical code paths.
- Do not log credentials, tokens, or personally identifiable information.
- Do not log implementation details; log observable behavior.
