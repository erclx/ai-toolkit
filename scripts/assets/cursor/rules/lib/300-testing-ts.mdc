# TYPESCRIPT/JAVASCRIPT TESTING TOOLING

## Unit and Integration

- Use Vitest for unit and integration tests.
- Co-locate unit tests with their respective components.
- Use `userEvent` for realistic interaction simulation in Vitest.
- Do not make real network calls in unit tests; use mocks.

## End-to-End

- Use Playwright for end-to-end tests.
- Place all Playwright tests within the `e2e/` directory.
- Do not place Playwright tests inside the `src/` directory.
