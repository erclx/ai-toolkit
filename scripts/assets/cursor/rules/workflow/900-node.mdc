# NODE WORKFLOW STANDARDS

## HARD REQUIREMENTS

- Analyze requests and output a numbered implementation plan before execution.
- Execute fail-fast verification: `bun run format` → `bun run lint:fix` → `bun run typecheck` → `bun run test` → `bun run build`.
- Run `bun run lint:spell` after other checks pass or as a final optional step.
- Stage all modified files using `git add .` and verify with `git status`.
- Signal completion to the user for manual review and commit.

## NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS

- Do not execute `git commit`; hand off the staged environment to the user.
- Do not proceed to the next step if the current step fails.
- Do not modify code without a confirmed plan.
- Do not run E2E tests (`test:e2e`) in the standard workflow; reserve for manual execution or CI.
