# AI Core Toolkit

A high-fidelity Gemini extension for Senior Principal Architects. This toolkit provides automated reconnaissance, atomic commits, and evidence-based PR generation.

## 🏗️ Architecture: The Ghost Folder

This toolkit utilizes a **Ghost Folder** pattern to maintain project state without polluting your source code. 



- **`.gemini/.tmp/`**: Acts as the "AI Brain." 
- **Persistence**: While the AI session resets, the `scout_report.md` stored here ensures the agent retains "Architectural Memory" of your tech stack, versions, and gaps.
- **Security**: All temporary artifacts are strictly ignored via `.geminiignore`.

## 🚀 Installation

1. `git clone <repo_url>`
2. `gemini extensions link .`

## 🛠️ Commands

- `/core-toolkit.setup:init` - Scaffold project infrastructure and security rules.
- `/core-toolkit.agent:scout` - Perform deep architectural reconnaissance and audit.
- `/core-toolkit.git:commit` - Generate semantic, conventional commit messages.
- `/core-toolkit.git:pr` - Create documentation-driven PR drafts.

## 📜 Principles

1. **Document Reality**: We document what is actually in the code, not what we hope will be there.
2. **Signal over Noise**: Metadata is filtered to ensure the AI focuses on load-bearing architectural decisions.
3. **Idempotency**: All setup commands are safe to run multiple times.
