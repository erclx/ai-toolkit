 * `secret`, or `token` fires on the environment reads, the workflow inputs, and
 * the prose that name those things, and this repository ships all three. The
 * cost is a credential no issuer stamps with a recognizable prefix, which this
 * set does not reach and no exclusion would have helped with either.
 *
 * None of these sources matches itself, so this file is in scope like any
 * other. Each literal prefix is followed here by a character class rather than
 * by the class's own members, and `src/secrets/scan.test.ts` holds the check.
