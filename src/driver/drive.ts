/**
 * Walks a page through a caller's interaction sequence and measures each state
 * it reaches. Every browser reference the driver adds lives here, and
 * `src/commands/driver.ts` reaches it through a dynamic import so no other
 * command resolves the engine at startup.
 *
 * Like `@/demo/drive` and `@/inventory/walk`, and unlike `@/capture/render`,
 * this module ships. A command whose whole purpose is measuring someone else's
 * page cannot stay toolkit-only, and nothing here reaches into `@/capture/`,
 * which `files` in `package.json` excludes from the published package, so the
 * two surfaces move independently.
 *
 * What separates it from `canon capture` is the axis it adds. A render answers
 * about a page as it loads, and every defect that exists only after a menu
 * opens, an answer is chosen, or the page scrolls is invisible to one. Probes
 * therefore run after a step rather than on arrival, and a run reaches the load
 * state by opening with a `wait` step of its own. That matters most where
 * capture does not run, since it is toolkit-only and this command is then the
 * only thing measuring the page at all.
