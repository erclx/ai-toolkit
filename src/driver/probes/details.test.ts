/**
 * Pins both halves of the closed-menu lesson against one fixture, because the
 * two pull opposite ways and a suite covering either alone would pass a probe
 * that fails the other.
 *
 * The menu here is the shape that produced 134 false findings: shut, the
 * element measures a summary and nothing else, so anything judged from that box
 * is judged from a number about the trigger rather than about the menu. Open,
 * it is the shape the same run missed, a panel hanging off the right edge of a
 * phone-width viewport and true only while open.
 *
 * The suite needs a browser binary. CI installs none, so it skips there rather
 * than failing, which means a green pipeline is not evidence this passed.

/**
 * A narrow trigger, and a panel that lands 35px past the right edge only once
 * the menu is open. The offset hangs off `details[open]` rather than off layout
 * flow, and that is deliberate: this Chromium hands a closed `<details>` a full
 * layout box for its contents, so a fixture that merely hid the panel would
 * still measure it shut and prove nothing about which state was read.
