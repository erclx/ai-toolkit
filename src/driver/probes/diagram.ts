 * Reads SVG label geometry off the rendered page, in two probes that differ by

 * Everything here is measured in the browser after `document.fonts.ready` and
 * never computed from the markup, because a generated page is routinely
 * authored against one font and rendered in another. A stylesheet restyling
 * `figure svg text` to a hand face after the coordinates were picked against
 * monospace moves every label, so a label that cleared a line at its authored
 * width can overlap it once rendered and the markup still says it does not.
 *
 * `clientWidth` is not the reading. Comparing it to `scrollWidth` flags every
 * label whose string is wider than its element box whether or not anything is
 * actually cut, which is why both probes are geometry against other geometry.

 * itself touches almost none of it, so the box would report the opposite error
 * once the fill filter came off.
