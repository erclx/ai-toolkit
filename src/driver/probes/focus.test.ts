/**
 * Pins the two false-finding classes this probe was built against.
 *
 * The first is the `.focus()`-versus-Tab divergence, and the control below is
 * the reader that produced 27 false findings against a page whose rings were
 * all present. It only diverges once the page has taken a pointer interaction,
 * which is why the control clicks first: on a page nobody has touched, Chromium
 * matches `:focus-visible` for a scripted focus and the cheap reader looks
 * correct. A driver clicks by definition, so every state it measures after its
 * first `click` step is the state where the cheap reader breaks.
 *
 * The second is an outline sub-property moving underneath an outline that
 * resolves to `none`, which is a computed difference that paints nothing.
 * `#quiet` in the fixture is that shape rather than an invented one: it clears
 * `outline` for itself while the broader rule still sets `outline-offset`.
 *
 * The suite needs a browser binary. CI installs none, so it skips there rather
 * than failing, which means a green pipeline is not evidence this passed.
