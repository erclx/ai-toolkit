/**
 * Reports every element that takes focus and changes nothing a person can see.
 *
 * The lesson is in the first line of the run rather than in the comparison. A
 * probe that focuses each element and reads its computed outline reports every
 * correctly styled element as unstyled, because `:focus-visible` does not match
 * a scripted `.focus()` while the browser is in pointer modality. That version
 * produced 27 false findings against a page whose rings were all present. One
 * Tab press ahead of the read puts the page in keyboard modality and the rule
 * matches for the rest of the pass, which is why `enterKeyboardModality` is a
 * shared helper rather than a line here.
 *
 * The reader below is serialized to source and evaluated by the browser, so
 * every helper it needs is declared inside its own body. A reference to
 * anything at module scope typechecks and throws once the page calls it.
