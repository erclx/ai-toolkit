/**
 * Drives a served page through one interaction at two viewport heights, because
 * the property this command exists for cannot be shown at one height or in one
 * state. The fixture's defect is both: it needs the menu open, and it needs the
 * short viewport, so a run that skipped either reports the page clean.
 *
 * The suite needs a browser binary. CI installs none, so it skips there rather
 * than failing, which means a green pipeline is not evidence this passed. Run
 * it locally, or read the manual pass recorded with the feature.
 */

/**
 * A menu whose open panel is pushed off the right edge only where the viewport
 * is short. Contrived in its mechanism and not in its shape: a layout that
 * reflows below a height breakpoint is ordinary, and the defect it hides is the
 * scroll rail that passed at one height and failed at two others.
