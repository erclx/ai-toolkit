# ERROR HANDLING STANDARDS

## Boundary Validation

- Validate inputs at system boundaries; reject invalid data immediately.
- Do not use exceptions for control flow.

## Error Classification

- Distinguish expected failures (validation, not found) from unexpected failures (null reference, network timeout).
- Return structured error types for recoverable failures; propagate exceptions for programmer errors.

## Error Propagation

- Handle errors at the layer that has enough context to respond meaningfully; do not catch and rethrow without adding value.
- Do not silently ignore errors.

## Error Reporting

- Include actionable context in error messages; never expose internal implementation details.

## Retry Behavior

- Retry only idempotent operations with bounded attempts and backoff.
