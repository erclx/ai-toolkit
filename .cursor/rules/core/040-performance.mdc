# PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

## Resource Loading

- Lazy load resources at architectural boundaries, not inline.
- Do not import entire modules when subsets are sufficient.

## Execution Efficiency

- Batch independent operations; avoid sequential execution when parallelizable.
- Defer non-critical work until after primary output completes.
- Do not fetch data inside loops.

## Data Handling

- Paginate or stream unbounded data sets.
- Do not optimize without measurement.
