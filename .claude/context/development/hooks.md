# Hooks

## Shell scripts

All `.sh` files live under `scripts/`, except Claude Code hooks, which live in `.claude/hooks/`. Do not place shell scripts anywhere else.

## Claude hooks

`.claude/hooks/` holds the toolkit's own Claude Code hooks, wired through `.claude/settings.json`. Five carry the same names as the hooks `aitk claude init` seeds from `tooling/claude/seeds/.claude/hooks/`, covered in `.claude/context/claude-plugin/cli.md`, and four of those are byte-identical to their seeded copies.

### The stdin guard

Every hook that reads a payload opens with `IFS= read -r -d '' -t 2 input` and exits non-zero with a usage line on an empty payload. Under Claude Code the payload arrives and stdin closes, so the read returns at once and the bound is never paid. An unbounded `cat` instead blocks forever when a caller runs the hook by hand or from a tool call whose stdin is an open socket, which holds the background task open and with it the session. Only `bare-flag-repair.sh` is exempt, and it is exempt because it reads no payload.

`read` rather than `timeout cat`, because macOS ships no `timeout` and a missing one empties every payload and refuses every legitimate call. The obvious descriptor test `[ -t 0 ]` is the wrong one, since it reports false on an open socket, which is where the hang came from. Nothing compares the two hook trees, so a guard landing in one leaves the other broken with every stage still passing. `src/hooks-guard.test.ts` walks both directories rather than a fixed list, asserting per file a bounded refusal, silence on a payload the hook ignores, and the real verdict on one it acts on.

The acting payload is what a mangled read fails. A corrupted payload reaches the same quiet exit as one naming a tool the hook filters out, so a test built on the filtered case passes whatever the read did to the bytes. Each hook therefore carries a payload reaching the branch that does its work, paired with a string only that branch emits, and a hook added without one fails rather than passing on the refusal alone.

The two index hooks run with `aitk` dropped from `PATH`, which pins them to the branch reporting a stale index instead of leaving the assertion to depend on whether the CLI is installed.

### The dev command reminder

`dev-command-reminder.sh` is toolkit-only and has no seed counterpart. It fires once per session when a `Bash` command runs `check`, `format`, or `check:install`, and points the agent at this domain. The matcher tests the command string rather than the tool name, because `Bash` is the highest-frequency tool in a session and a loose matcher would add latency to every shell call. It stays silent on `check:types` and `test`, which need no reminder.

The filter, the match, and the session id come out of one `jq` pass, so the hot path costs a single process and the second `jq` runs only when the hook actually fires. Splitting the fields through `@tsv` instead looks equivalent and is not: `@tsv` escapes a newline to a literal `\n`, which puts a backslash where the matcher expects whitespace or end of string, and every multi-line command stops matching. A run with no `session_id` exits rather than sharing one marker file, since per-session dedupe needs a real id.

The `entry` the hook names is guarded on existing, so a path this repository does not carry disables the reminder in silence rather than failing it. That target is `.claude/context/development/index.md`, the catalog naming every sibling, because the gotchas the reminder exists to surface sit in several of them and no one file holds the set.

### The bare flag repair

`bare-flag-repair.sh` shares the `Bash` matcher and clears `core.bare` when worktree entry has left it set. Git refuses every operation while the flag is on, which puts `post-checkout` and the rest of the husky hooks out of reach, so a tool call is the only event that still fires ahead of the command that would fail. `verify.sh` keeps its own call to the same repair, but a planning or review session reads git constantly and runs the suite never, so the suite alone leaves such a session broken for its whole length.

The hook writes to the shared git config as a side effect of an unrelated `Bash` call, so it announces the repair through `additionalContext` rather than clearing the flag silently. It sources `repair_bare_flag` from `scripts/lib/worktree.sh` rather than restating the predicate, and stubs `log_warn` before the source so the library warning lands in a variable instead of on stdout, where an unframed line corrupts the hook protocol.

The flag read comes first and costs one process, ahead of the payload parse, because every invocation but a handful stops there. That measured at roughly 2ms against 3.6ms for `dev-command-reminder.sh` on the same matcher, so the two stay separate hooks.

### Linting the hooks

`check:shell` lints `.claude/hooks/` alongside `scripts/` and `tooling/`. It has to, because the shell stage is gated on any `.sh` change. Linting a narrower set than the gate keys on produces a stage that fires on a hook edit, inspects other directories, and reports a pass that says nothing about the file that triggered it. Keep the glob and the gate pattern in step whenever either moves.

## Husky hooks

- `pre-commit` runs `lint-staged` (prettier, cspell, shfmt, shellcheck on staged files).
- `commit-msg` runs `commitlint` against the conventional commit format.
- `pre-push` runs `bun run check`. After pushing, run `git status`. If files changed, commit the diff as `style(<scope>):` and push again.
- `post-merge` archives the task each merged pull request closed and stays silent otherwise. It is the only trigger that fires after a merge, covered in `.claude/context/claude-plugin/skill-archiving.md`. It reads `ORIG_HEAD..HEAD` rather than the tip, since one pull routinely fast-forwards over several merges and reading `git log -1` would strand every task but the last.
- `post-merge` then runs `aitk records push`, which backs the eight gitignored record folders to a private remote. The call sits last so an unreachable remote delays no archiving, and it fires on every merge rather than on one that closed a task, since a review report and a memory entry both land on runs that close nothing.
- A checkout that never ran the one-time setup answers `no-repository` and reports nothing
- `post-rewrite` delegates to `post-merge` on the `rebase` argument, so a `pull.rebase=true` machine gets the same check. It exits on `amend`, which rewrites nothing on the board.

Husky runs every hook as `sh -e "$hook"`, so the shebang on both is advisory and the file is POSIX sh under errexit whatever it declares. A bare `grep` that matches nothing aborts the hook and prints a husky failure on a clean pull, which is why each test sits inside an `if` condition rather than standing alone. Errexit exempts a condition and nothing else.

`check:shell` globs `*.sh` under `scripts`, `tooling`, and `.claude/hooks`, so no husky hook is linted. That cost nothing while all three were one-liners and now leaves two real scripts uncovered. Run `shellcheck --shell=sh .husky/post-merge .husky/post-rewrite` by hand after editing either.
