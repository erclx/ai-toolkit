# Internal tooling requirement

## Gap

Without this skill, a session writes a manifest key the parser skips without reporting it, duplicates a parent layer's config into a child where the copy drifts, changes a `base` config and leaves the repository root running the old one, and calls the change verified from a read of the diff.

The manifest failures are silent by construction. An unquoted script key and a multi-line gitignore array both parse to nothing, so sync completes, the target receives less than the manifest names, and the only symptom arrives later in a project nobody is watching. Reading the file back confirms the text is there, which is why the syntax has to be known before the edit rather than checked after it.

## Must

- Run the stack's end-to-end verify before calling a config, seed, or manifest change done, since scaffolding fresh is what separates a plausible config from a working one
- Ship only what differs from the parent layer, because a config duplicated for no reason drifts against the file it was copied from
- Port a `base` config change to the repository root as a delta, preserving the local overrides there, since the toolkit runs on its own base tooling

## Must not

- Write an unquoted key in a scripts block or a multi-line array in a gitignore block. Both parse to nothing and report success.
- Declare dev dependencies in a manifest whose runtime is not `bun`. Injection runs a `bun add`, so document the manual install step in that stack's reference instead.
- Route Claude work through the tooling CLI. That folder is storage rather than a stack, and its exclusion is read from one place that any change has to update.
- Seed agent-facing content under a stack's `docs/`, which is reserved for prose written for a human reader

## Guards

- Commit golden config changes without the pre-commit hook. Lint-staged runs against the template files themselves rather than project source, so it rewrites the thing being shipped.

## Out of scope

- Governance rules and stacks, which are a separate catalog reaching a target through a separate install: `internal-governance`
- The conventions a stack's `reference.md` follows, which the internal tooling-reference standard states
- The content of the seeded Claude planning docs, which `internal-claude` owns. This skill owns how a seed layers, merges, and survives sync.
